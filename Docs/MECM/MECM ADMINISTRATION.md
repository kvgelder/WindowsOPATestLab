### Device enrollment
By default MECM will check for domain joined devices ever 60 minutes. If new devices have been discovered, they will be enrolled into MECM Mobile Device Management (MDM).

This interval can be modified via the Administration/Client Settings/Default Client Settings/Enrollment option page.
